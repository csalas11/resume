# README

This project was for my CS121: Software Development course at Harvey Mudd. 

We were asked to have fun and create something using Ruby on Rails

The following links were used while creating my resume website. Would like to thank all these open source projects and youtube tutorials for helping me to complete this
assignment.

This website used a theme from StartBootstrap called Freelancer. It is mainly used for Graphic Desiginers specializing in UX and UI, which is what I plan to do someday. There are some compatability issues I still need to fix, such as the scroll down menu not working. Otherwise, the page has been modified to my liking. I attempted to add a download_pdf generator that would allow for my resume to be downloaded. It crashed everything and had to restart my git. 

This was all done using component based methods, since I gathered other peoples components and gave credit, in order to create something for myself.
