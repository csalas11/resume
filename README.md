# README

This project was for my CS121: Software Development course at Harvey Mudd. 

We were asked to have fun and create something using Ruby on Rails

The following links were used while creating my resume website. Would like to thank all these open source projects and youtube tutorials for helping me to complete this
assignment.

Paperclip GitHub link: https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip

This website used a theme from StartBootstrap called Freelancer. It is mainly used for Graphic Desiginers specializing in UX and UI, which is what I plan to do someday. There are some compatability issues I still need to fix, such as the scroll down menu not working. Otherwise, the page has been modified to my liking. I attempted to add a download_pdf generator that would allow for my resume to be downloaded. It crashed everything and had to restart my git. 


This was all done using component based methods, since I gathered other peoples components and gave credit, in order to create something for myself. Gained a lot of experience reading other peoples code and figuring out what everything does.


It took me about a week and a half to get this theme to work, lots of trial and error. Some tutorials didn't help since they were for earlier versions of Ruby/Rails. Was also at a conference and finally got it to work on a plane flying back to California. Will definitely go back to this website and make sure everything works. 



![MainPage](https://github.com/csalas11/resume/blob/master/screenshots/mainPage.png?raw=true)
This is the main page with an image of myself I edited using Photoshop to fit the page well. 


![NavBarHi](https://github.com/csalas11/resume/blob/master/screenshots/navBarHighlight.png?raw=true)
This is the main navigation bar being highlighted. 

![MenuHi](https://github.com/csalas11/resume/blob/master/screenshots/menuHighlight.png?raw=true)
This is the menu highlight on the top right when the mouse hovers over it. Mostly done using CSS .hover action. 


![SkillsUnmoved](https://github.com/csalas11/resume/blob/master/screenshots/SkillsUnmoved.png?raw=true)
This is the skills section, with the courses I've taken, along with images I added from the internet in order to show some sort of timeline/progress of the CS I've done throughout college. This one is when the screen is large, such as a desktop, had issues rearranging them to the center, might actually work out for better since I think I want to have the left side with courses, and right side with languages I've worked with. 

![skillsMoved](https://github.com/csalas11/resume/blob/master/screenshots/skillsMoved.png?raw=true)
This is how it looks when the screen is something like a mobile phone, it centers automatically, but for whatever reason won't do it when in full screen.

![skillsHighlight](https://github.com/csalas11/resume/blob/master/screenshots/skillsHighlight.png?raw=true)
When you hover over the image it turns a light shade of blue, using hover, and RGB transperancy values on CSS file. 

![moreSkills](https://github.com/csalas11/resume/blob/master/screenshots/moreSkills.png?raw=true)
More of the skills section


![about](https://github.com/csalas11/resume/blob/master/screenshots/about.png?raw=true)
The about me section of the website, which just gives a little bit of insight as to who I am and what I'm interested in when it comes to being a software engineer. 

![fullInfo](https://github.com/csalas11/resume/blob/master/screenshots/fullInfo.png?raw=true)
About me section on full screen desktop mode. Not compressed. 


![contact](https://github.com/csalas11/resume/blob/master/screenshots/contact.png?raw=true)
The contact form, that I believe will work, since I added a missing PHP File and editted it accordingly. Will know for sure when I have my website on the internet. May require setting up some sort of server as well, will cross that road when I get to it. 

![fullContact](https://github.com/csalas11/resume/blob/master/screenshots/fullContact.png?raw=true)
Contact form on full screen desktop mode. Not compressed.

![info](https://github.com/csalas11/resume/blob/master/screenshots/info.png?raw=true)
Info page showing different ways to contact me online through LinkedIn, or mail me something. 



Had lots of fun working on this, despite the times of desperation, glad I was finally able to get the theme working and then understanding the code to modify it was also really fun.
